# pytorch-CIFAR10
Joe Everton - Brian Hicks - April 2019

This project is based on a home work assignment from an applied machine learning course taken in 2019 at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign.  This course is currently not offered there, and the professor who wrote the assignment has left the university, so it is believed that this project will not directly help with any current homework assignment.

The course was a broad survey of applied ML.  CV, CNN's, and Pytorch were just one of many topics covered, so the instructor provided a notebook with some start-up pytorch code, and turned us loose to meet the requirements based on what we had learned in lectures and what we could find online.

For the assignment, Brian and I built some simple networks and trained them.  For the last part, we were asked to come up with something more advanced, either on our own or from networks we learned about online.  There was a leaderboard and contest to get the best classification rate.

Brian and I collaborated on assignments the whole semester, as was encouraged, but we decided early on that rather than working on the same code, we would implement the homeworks solo, and then compare notes, combine, and submit the best code between us.  We thought this would help us get the most out of the course.

For this submission, we included both of our final network implementations, and a discussion on the tuning of both of them.  You can see this in the final result.
